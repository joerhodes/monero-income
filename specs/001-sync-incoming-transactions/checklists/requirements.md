# Specification Quality Checklist: Sync Incoming Wallet Transactions

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-10-12
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Passed on the first validation pass. Ambiguities were resolved as documented defaults
  (see the spec's Edge Cases and Assumptions) rather than [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers.
  The ones most worth confirming in `/speckit-clarify`: all incoming transfers vs. mining
  payouts only, skipping unconfirmed transactions, and one record per transaction id when a
  transaction pays several subaddresses.
